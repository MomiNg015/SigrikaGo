## Overview

<!--
Document your project's quality standards here.

Questions to answer:
- What patterns are forbidden?
- What linting rules do you enforce?
- What are your testing requirements?
- What code review standards apply?

## Forbidden Patterns

## Required Patterns

<!-- Patterns that must always be used -->

### Leaderboard API Contract

`GET /api/leaderboard` returns users who have at least one completed game. Each player row must include:

- `id`, `username`, `rating`, `rank`, `itemEffects`
- `totalGames`, `wins`, `losses`, `draws`
- `commonCharacter`

`draws` is a first-class response field, not a frontend-only derived value. `buildLeaderboard()` increments it when `recordWinnerColor(record)` returns no winner, and tests should assert draw counts alongside wins and losses.

Wrong:

```js
return { totalGames: row.totalGames, wins: row.wins, losses: row.losses };
```

Correct:

```js
return { totalGames: row.totalGames, wins: row.wins, losses: row.losses, draws: row.draws };
```

## Testing Requirements

<!-- What level of testing is expected -->

- Leaderboard changes should update `server/leaderboard.test.js` with base win/loss/draw cases, including at least one draw record.
